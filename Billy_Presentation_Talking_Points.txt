Thank you for passing it over to me, Jumoke! I'll be test driving our, simple, but very festive, Tableau dashboard with you all today. Tis the season for green and red! 

Our dashboard was created using Tableau and is hosted on Tableau Public. 

For our dashboard, we have created 3 separate visuals, 2 of which have corresponding legends, and a manual filter that allows users to select one or multiple states to compare data.  

Max Early Career Pay by State (interactive map of the United States)
Annual Tuition vs. Early Career Salary - we should update this to say "Pay" instead of "Salary"
Diversity by University. 
The Max Early Career Pay by State Map allows the user to hover over each state to view information for any state they are interested in. 
When hovering over a state, information is populated in a pop up box. 
The name of the state, the highest early career pay for a graduate in the state, the name of the university with the highest early career pay in the state, they type of university (public or private), the average early career pay for the state, the average in-state tuition for the state, and the average out of state tuition for the state. 
The map is color coded with a green scale where lighter green indicates the lowest early career pay. The scale moves through darker shades of green all the way to the darkest shade which indicates the highest early career pay. The scale goes from 51k (the lowest early career pay) to 91k (the highest early career pay). 
The main land of the US makes up the majority of the map with Alaska and Hawaii also included on the bottom left of the map. 
Users can select a single state if there is a specific state they are interested in. They can also hold control and select multiple states. Additionally, the user can click and drag to select multiple states if they prefer that method. 
Selecting one state or multiple states will update the Annual Tuition vs. Early Career Salary section and the Diversity by University section of the dashboard. 
Clicking in the white space on the map will deselect your selections.
A user can click a university in the Diversity by University section to update the Annual Tuition v. Early Career Pay section to perform a comparison. 


Diversity

Call outs
Some universities do not populate diversity graph as diversity information was not available for those universities. 
Selecting a state on the map is not tied to the filter on the right. They are independent. However, using either method will update the dashboard visuals.
