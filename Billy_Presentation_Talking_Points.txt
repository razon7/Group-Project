Our presentation dashboard was made in Tableau. 
There are 3 parts to our dashboard.
Max Early Career Pay by State (interactive map of the United States)
Annual Tuition vs. Early Career Salary - we should update this to say "Pay" instead of "Salary"
Diversity by University. 
The Max Early Career Pay by State Map allows the user to hover over each state to view information for any state they are interested in. 
When hovering over a state, information is populated in a pop up box. 
The name of the state, the highest early career pay for a graduate in the state, the name of the university with the highest early career pay in the state, they type of university (public or private), the average early career pay for the state, the average in-state tuition for the state, and the average out of state tuition for the state. 
The map is color coded with a green scale where lighter green indicates the lowest early career pay. The scale moves through darker shades of green all the way to the darkest shade which indicates the highest early career pay. The scale goes from 51k (the lowest early career pay) to 91k (the highest early career pay). 
The main land of the US makes up the majority of the map with Alaska and Hawaii also included on the bottom left of the map. 
Users can select a single state if there is a specific state they are interested in. They can also hold control and select multiple states. Additionally, the user can click and drag to select multiple states if they prefer that method. 
Selecting one state or multiple states will update the Annual Tuition vs. Early Career Salary section and the Diversity by University section of the dashboard. 

Call outs
Some universities do not populate diversity graph as diversity information was not available for those universities. 

What we would do different.


Is there a way to make the filters not overlap the graphs? 
Should we update "Annual Tuition v. Early Career Salary" to "Annual Tuition vs. Early Career Pay?"
Walk through "Annual Tuition v. Early Career Salary section again.
Left is in state and right is out of state. Are we just sandwiching early career pay with the in state and out of state? 
Does selecting a state on the map serve the same function as selecting a state in the filter? 
Can we add a scroll bar to the annual tuition section?
