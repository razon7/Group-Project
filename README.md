## Communication Protocols
* Slack will be the primary communcation tool. Outside of our classes held on Mondays and Wednesdays, we intend to meet after class and on an as-needed basis each week. 
* All updates to the main branch within GitHub will require approval from a minimum of two team members. 

## Technologies and Platforms

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
* **Python** along with the **Pandas library** will be used to clean any data and perform initial analysis. 

### Database Storage
* **Postgresql** is our chosen database.

### Machine Learning 
* **SckiKitLearn** is the ML library we intend to use. 

### Dashboard
* **Tableau** will be used to create and host our dashboard.
